                        <h3>Server Side Includes</h3>
                        <p>Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost
                            exclusively for the World Wide Web. It is most useful for including the contents of one or
                            more files into a web page on a web server (see below), using its <code>#include</code>
                            directive. This could commonly be a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page
                            header, a page footer and a navigation menu. SSI also contains control directives for
                            conditional features and directives for calling external programs. It is supported by
                            Apache, LiteSpeed, nginx, IIS as well as W3C's Jigsaw. It has its roots in NCSA HTTPd.</p>
                        <p>In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file and therefore carry out these
                            instructions, either the filename should end with a special extension, by default
                            <code>.shtml</code>, <code>.stm</code>, <code>.shtm</code>, or, if the server is configured
                            to allow this, set the execution bit of the file.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Examples</h3>
                        <p>
                            A web page containing a daily quotation could include the quotation by placing the following
                            code into the file of the web page:</p>
                        <pre><code>&lt;!--#include file="../quote.txt" --&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            With one change of the quote.txt file, all pages that include the file will display the
                            latest daily quotation. The inclusion is not limited to files, and may also be the text
                            output from a program, or the value of a system variable such as the current time.</p>

                    <h1>What is SSI Server</h1>
                    <p>SSI Server is a simple Python3 script that serves as HTTP server that supports SSI directive.
                        However, it only helps HTML developers build better pages by better structure. It generates all
                        HTML pages without SSI, and helps deploys on those servers that only support HTML. e.g. GitHub
                        pages.</p>
                    <p>SSI Server supports one and the only one directive: <code>include</code> with <code>file</code>:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;!--#include file="inc/header.html" --&gt;</code></pre>
                    <h3>How SSI Server Works</h3>
                    <p>SSI Server handles <code>/index.html</code> by processing underlying <code>/index.shtml</code>.
                        The <code>index.html</code> file is generated or updated by <code>./ssi_server.py -g</code>.
                    </p>
